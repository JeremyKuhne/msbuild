.SYNOPSIS
    Capture a matrix of short commands, each run repeatedly inside one ETW session, then
    write a capture manifest the filtrace batch and diff verbs read.

.DESCRIPTION
    A short command is the hardest thing to profile honestly. Starting and flushing an ETW
    session costs far more than a 30-100 ms process takes to run, so capturing one
    invocation yields a trace that is mostly capture overhead with too few samples to rank.
    This runs each scenario N times inside a single session: the session cost is paid once
    per scenario, one trace is converted instead of many thin ones, and the samples add up
    to something rankable.

    Each scenario becomes one case in a `manifest.json` of kind `command`, so
    `filtrace batch` ranks the whole matrix in one call and `filtrace diff` pairs two runs
    of it by scenario name. Every launch is recorded with its root process id and window,
    which is what lets an analysis attribute work to a particular run rather than to the
    scenario as a whole.

    ETW is machine-wide and needs Administrator, so this self-elevates once for the whole
    matrix rather than per scenario - one UAC prompt no matter how many scenarios run.

    A scenario that fails does not discard the run: it is recorded as a warning and the
    manifest is written with the cases that did succeed, so a long matrix is not lost to
    one bad command.

    filtrace: https://github.com/JeremyKuhne/filtrace - install once with
    `dotnet tool install -g KlutzyNinja.Filtrace`, or drive the MCP trace_* tools.

.PARAMETER Scenario
    The commands to capture. Each entry is a hashtable with Name, Command, and optional
    Arguments, for example:

        -Scenario @(
            @{ Name = 'version'; Command = 'dotnet'; Arguments = '--version' },
            @{ Name = 'build';   Command = 'dotnet'; Arguments = 'build --no-restore' })

    Names must be unique; they are the case identity that diff pairs on.

.PARAMETER Iterations
    How many times to launch each command inside its session. Default 25, which is enough
    for a 30-100 ms command to clear the sample count filtrace treats as directional.

.PARAMETER CaptureProfile
    Capture profile: startup (default), cpu, or threadtime. `startup` enables only the
    keywords a startup and CPU analysis reads, which is the lowest-perturbation choice for
    a short command.

.PARAMETER CpuSampleMSec
    CPU sample interval in milliseconds. Default 1 (the ETW default). A 30-100 ms command
    gets only tens of samples at 1 ms, so lower it - sub-millisecond sampling is honored,
    down to roughly 0.12 ms on the Windows 11 machine this was measured on - and the
    manifest records what was requested against what the machine actually honored.

.PARAMETER OutputDirectory
    Run directory for the traces, manifest, and log. Defaults to a run-stamped directory
    under ./perf-traces.

.PARAMETER SymbolsDirectory
    Optional build-output directory recorded against every case, so batch and diff resolve
    source lines without being told again.

.PARAMETER FiltracePath
    Path to a specific filtrace executable. Defaults to the one on PATH. Point this at a
    local build when testing changes to the tool itself, or when the installed version is
    older than the options this script needs.

.PARAMETER ElevatedTimeoutSeconds
    How long the non-elevated parent waits for the elevated child before giving up.
    Default 1800 (30 minutes).

.PARAMETER SpecPath
    Internal. Set on the elevated relaunch to point at the serialized scenario matrix.

.PARAMETER LogFile
    Internal. Set on the elevated relaunch so the calling console can surface the output.

.EXAMPLE
    ./Capture-CommandTrace.ps1 -Scenario @(@{ Name='version'; Command='dotnet'; Arguments='--version' })

.EXAMPLE
    ./Capture-CommandTrace.ps1 -Scenario $matrix -Iterations 50 -CaptureProfile cpu
